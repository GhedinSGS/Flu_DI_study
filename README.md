# Flu_DI_study

This repo contains scripts used to analyze data presented in the manuscript "Influenza defective interfering virus promotes multiciliated cell differentiation and reduces the inflammatory response in mice".

The datasets included bulk transcriptome and miRNA profiling, and viral genome sequencing data.

- The "Analyses_command.txt" contains commands for upstream sequencing data processing. 
- The "bulk-mRNA-miRNA_Differential-expression-and-network-analyses.Rmd" contains code for DGE and DE-miRNAs, and network analyses.
- The python scripts were used to process viral genome sequencing data.
